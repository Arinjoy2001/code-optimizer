# code-optimizer
optimizes and gives performance of the code
How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-code-optimizer.git
cd ai-code-optimizer
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure Python 3.8 or later is installed. Install required dependencies with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
Run the Streamlit application using:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
4. Use the Tool
Input Options:
Upload a Python code file (.py or .txt).
Paste the code directly into the provided text area.
Results:
View static analysis results for issues like cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index.
Get AI-powered suggestions for optimization.
Design Choices Made
1. Framework:
I chose Streamlit for its simplicity and rapid prototyping capabilities, making it easy to create an interactive interface for code analysis.

2. Analysis Workflow:
Static Analysis:
Uses the radon library for cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index calculation.
Provides a solid baseline for identifying potential structural issues in code.
AI-Powered Analysis:
Utilizes Hugging Face's EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M model for contextual suggestions.
Includes input truncation to handle token limits, ensuring compatibility with large code snippets.
3. User Interface Design:
Simple interface with two input methods:
File upload for .py and .txt files.
Text area for manual code input.
Results displayed in a clear JSON format, with download capability.
4. Flexibility for Future Enhancements:
Modular design:
Static analysis (static_analysis.py) and AI analysis (ai_analysis.py) are separate, making it easy to extend or replace components.
Scalable for additional programming languages or AI models.
Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions
Input Format:
The input is assumed to be Python code. Other languages are not currently supported.
Code Quality:
It is assumed that the uploaded code is syntactically valid.
Limitations
AI Model Token Limit:
The AI model has a token limit of 2048 (input + output). To manage this:
Input longer than 1024 tokens is truncated.
Suggestions may not consider the full context for long code snippets.
Model Context:
The AI model is pre-trained on general text and may lack domain-specific knowledge for highly specialized optimizations.
Static Analysis Scope:
Static analysis focuses on maintainability and complexity; it does not identify runtime performance bottlenecks.
Languages:
The tool currently supports only Python. Adding support for other languages would require additional tooling.
Future Enhancements
Dynamic Profiling:
Incorporate runtime profiling to identify bottlenecks in execution (e.g., using cProfile).
Language Support:
Extend support to other programming languages like JavaScript, Java, or C++.
Improved AI Context:
Fine-tune the AI model on a dataset of code and corresponding optimizations for better suggestions.
Cloud Deployment:
Deploy the app on a platform like AWS or Heroku for public access.
